                <h1 class="title">NBA rookies and their winning contributions</h1>
                <p>by Stanley Dai</p>
                <p>
                    Every year, hundreds of basketball players with hoop dreams enter into wacky spectacles known as 
                    the NBA draft and free agency, where teams select players based on their own needs and evaluation of these players’ talent. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a fan of one of the more woe-begotten franchises, the New Orleans Pelicans, I was pleasantly 
                    surprised to see three rookies make meaningful contributions to team success. 
                    Uniquely, all three rookies were former college upperclassmen, lauded for their maturity and poise. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many approaches to incorporating new talent, with various and often conflicting 
                    theories bandied about by NBA pundits and internet forums. One such adage is that 
                    older players are often more ready to make an immediate impact. 
                </p>
                <h3>Data and Analysis</h3>
                <p>To explore this proposition, I use data on rookies and teams from basketball-reference.com from 2014-2021. 
                    I select this time period mostly out of convenience - certain teams had different names prior 
                    to 2014. 
                </p>
                <p>For my purposes, contribution is measured as having played in at least 35% 
                    of all games, the statistical minimum for rookies to qualify for historic recognition by the NBA. 
                    Winning teams are defined as teams who win more than half of their games. 
                </p>
                <div class="plot-holder">
                    <iframe title="How many NBA rookies contribute?" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-hOU1m" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hOU1m/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="381"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                    </script>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The chart above describes the number of rookies who contributed to their respective 
                    teams over the last eight years. 85 percent of contributing rookies are younger 
                    than 23 years old, many of whom were drafted out of college.
                </p>
                <p>For nearly all ages, more rookies play for losing teams than winning teams, which makes some 
                    sense - teams out of the championship race are incentivized to bring in more new talent and give players 
                    more chances to develop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, it appears that contributing rookies under 21 are less 
                    likely than their older counterparts to be on winning teams. 
                </p>
                <p>Let’s explore another dimension of the same question - what is the magnitude of 
                    the contribution of rookies on winning teams? As a proxy for level of contribution, 
                    I use minutes played per-game. 
                </p>
                <div class="plot2-holder">
                    <p>
                        <iframe title="MPG of rookies contributing on winning teams" aria-label="Dot Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-9qwGL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9qwGL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="359"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                        </script>                    </p>
                </div>
                <p></p>
                
                <p>
                    While older rookies are more likely to be contributors on winning teams, on those same winning teams the median 
                    minutes-per-game generally decreases with age! My best, most irresponsible guess as to what might 
                    be going on here is that younger players must exhibit extraordinary talent in order catch the eye of good teams.
                    In other words, if you are a contending team taking a chance on a 19 year old, he better be pretty damn good. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As team-building strategy is predicated on a near infinite amount of confounding factors,
                     analysis provided can only be descriptive in nature. Future analysis could explore a longer time frame or incorporate players' draft position.
